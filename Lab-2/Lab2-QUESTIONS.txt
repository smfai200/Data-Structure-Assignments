Q1. A box of cookies can hold 24 cookies, and a container can hold 75 boxes of cookies. Write a
program that prompts the user to enter the total number of cookies, the number of cookies in a box, and
the number of cookie boxes in a container. The program then outputs the number of boxes and the
number of containers to ship the cookies. Note that each box must contain the specified number of
cookies, and each container must contain the specified number of boxes. If the last box of cookies
contains less than the number of specified cookies, you can discard it and output the number of leftover
cookies. Similarly, if the last container contains less than the number of specified boxes, you can discard
it and output the number of leftover boxes.

Q8. The population of a town A is less than the population of town B. However, the population of
town A is growing faster than the population of town B. Write a program that prompts the user to enter
the population and growth rate of each town. The program outputs after how many years the population of
town A will be greater than or equal to the population of town B and the populations of both the towns at
that time. (A sample input is: Population of town A 5000, growth rate of town A 4%, population of town
B 8000, and growth rate of town B 2%)
